			<div style="color:red">Please keep in mind that this is an extremely early version of the game.
								   This means that not all features are implemented yet, and the game is <br>
								   SUPER buggy. I am developing this game in my spare time as a full time
								   uni student, so development is very slow. Also, the game isn't optimised<br>
								   at all for slower hardware so it will run very slowly on certain computers.</div>
