- Continue the options menu.
- The code that deals with fonts is very bad code. Needs immediate attention. Need to change:
1. From pixels to something a bit more relative to your screen, 2. Add code that checks how
many pixels wide a drawn font will be. THEN we can finally 3. add code that checks if a mouse
has clicked on the "back" button. (very simple)


- Draw an static image for the censer on the right side.
- Draw images for the coal + incense.
- Code the coal and incense. Add a timer for the coal - maybe 
- Draw an animation with the bishop and the censer, censing! Maybe 3-5 frames.
- Implement the animation in software. This is tricky and will take a few hours to
perfect.
- Add the censer to the game (set up the usual variables and call imgLoad() func).
- Change the font from pixels to points(or something equivalent), to ensure that the text
will all be the same size across different resolutions and DPIs.


- Draw a "Game Over!" screen
- Code the "Game Over!" screen


For when the game is finished - fully coded:
- Draw the leaderboards button and code it.
- Code the "options" button - add a options screen.

Possible ideas:
- For now, the bishop's orientation is static. We could add the ability to rotate - so that he
can turn around and face east, for example. This would be tricky as we will need to draw a LOT
of sprites for each orientation - north, south, east and west. If the censer is animated, 
it could total close to an hundred extra sprites! This is strictly for after the game is finished.


Remember to update the following functions when new objects are added:
resetObjects()
returnObjects()
bishopNotHoldingAny()
remember to update totalImages each time a image is added!
