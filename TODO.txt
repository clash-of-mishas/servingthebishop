- Code drag-drop functionality for trikiri and dikiri.
- Bishop cannot hold trikiri and dikiri and staff at the same time.
- Draw image of bishop with trikiri and/or dikiri. (three total images - bishop&trikiri,
bishop&dikiri, bishop&trikiri&dikiri).
- Draw a "Game Over!" screen
- Code the "Game Over!" screen
- Start work on the censer. Idea - maybe make an animation of bishop cesning?
Provide similar functionality as the staff - drag and drop, and take from
the bishop. Maybe add coal+incense too? So that you need to prepare it before 
you can give it to the bishop.


For when the game is finished - fuly coded:
- Draw the leaderboards button and code it.
- Code the "options" button - add a options screen.
