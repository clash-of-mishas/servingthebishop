- Add another bishop image, but with the staff.
- Code so that you can drag-drop the staff on the bishop, and the bishop's image
should turn from default to with-staff, and vice versa - click on the bishop
and get the staff from him and put the staff back on the right side. Bishop's
image goes back to normal.

menu, draw a image. 
- Draw "Start", "Options" and "Leaderboards" buttons for the main menu.
- Code the "Game Over!" screen
